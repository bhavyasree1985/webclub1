    <h1>Nature</h1>
    <!--Introduction-->
    <p>Welcome to the Wikipedia page dedicated to the topic of Nature.
       Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe.
       "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. 
       The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. 
       Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a 
       separate category from other natural phenomena.
       The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word 
       natura, or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, 
       literally meant "birth".In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin 
       translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic 
       characteristics of plants, animals, and other features of the world to develop of their 
       own accord.The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several
       expansions of the original notion;it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις
       by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for 
       Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency ever since.

    <!--Water on Earth-->
    <h2>Water on Earth</h2>
    <p>Water is a chemical substance that is composed of hydrogen and oxygen (H2O) and is vital 
       for all known forms of life.In typical usage, water refers only to its liquid form or state,
       but the substance also has a solid state, ice, and a gaseous state, water vapor, or steam.
       Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface.On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other 
       large bodies of water, with 1.6% of water below ground in aquifers and 0.001% in the air as vapor,
       clouds, and precipitation.Oceans hold 97% of surface water, glaciers, and polar ice caps
       2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%. Additionally, a 
       minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.

    <!--Atomsphere,Weather,Climate-->
    <h2>Atomsphere,Weather,Climate</h2>
    <p>The Earth's atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining the ecosystem. The thin layer of gases 
       that envelops the Earth is held in place by gravity. Air is mostly nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor,
       with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, etc. The atmospheric pressure declines 
       steadily with altitude. The ozone layer plays an important role in depleting the amount of 
       ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As DNA is readily damaged by UV light, 
       this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night,
       thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.
    </p>
    <!--Ecosystems-->
    <h2>Ecosystems</h2>
    <p>Ecosystems are composed of a variety of biotic and abiotic components that function in an
       interrelated way.The structure and composition is determined by various environmental factors
       that are interrelated. Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic modifications to the
       ecosystem. Some of the more important components are soil, atmosphere, radiation from the sun, 
       water, and living organisms.
    </p>
    <!--Wilderness-->
    <h2>Wilderness</h2>
    <p>Wilderness is generally defined as areas that have not been significantly modified by human
       activity. Wilderness areas can be found in preserves, estates, farms, conservation preserves, 
       ranches, national forests, national parks, and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches, or 
       otherwise undeveloped areas. Wilderness areas and protected parks are considered important for the
       survival of certain species, ecological studies, conservation, and solitude. Some nature writers 
       believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity,and some ecologists 
       consider wilderness areas to be an integral part of the Earth's self-sustaining natural ecosystem
       (the biosphere). They may also preserve historic genetic traits and that they provide habitat for
       wild flora and fauna that may be difficult or impossible to recreate in zoos, arboretums, or
       laboratories.
    </p>
    <!--Evolution-->
    <h2>Evolution</h2>
    <p>The origin of life on Earth is not well understood, but it is known to have occurred at least
       3.5 billion years ago,during the hadean or archean eons on a primordial Earth that 
       had a substantially different environment than is found at present.These life forms possessed 
       the basic traits of self-replication and inheritable traits. Once life had appeared, the process
       of evolution by natural selection resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms.
    </p>
    <!--Plants and Animals-->
    <h2>Planta and Animals</h2>
    <p>Originally Aristotle divided all living things between plants, which generally do not move fast
       enough for humans to notice, and animals. In Linnaeus' system, these became the kingdoms 
       Vegetabilia (later Plantae) and Animalia. Since then, it has become clear that the Plantae as
       originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the fungi and several groups of algae 
       were removed to new kingdoms. However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts. 
       Bacterial life is sometimes included in flora,and some classifications use the term bacterial 
       flora separately from plant flora.
